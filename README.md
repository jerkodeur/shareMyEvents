# shareMyEvents
This project is borned as part of my masterpiece to pass the application designer developer certification (CDA in french)

The ultimate goal of my application is to allow people to share a collaborative meal and to offer different services revolving around it such as managing an agenda, offering several dates to guests, having a chat channel, and so on.

Originally, I wanted to create an application in order to offer people the opportunity to create public outings and to offer them to other people who share the same passion.  
However, after careful research, I found there were many such applications out there, which were struggling to gain traction.   
Being myself a user of this kind of applications, I realised that there was not really offer for private events in which we just wanted to propose to his friends, his family, to participate in a meal, an evening, or more and to be able to centralize the needs within the same application.  
A lot of features came to me but I decided to focus on those that seemed essential to me to start.

As part of my masterpiece, given the limited time I have, I decided to focus on creating events, being able to share them with other people, creating an account and the management of its events for registered members of the site.

Here are the main features my app
- Create an event
- Share it with another people
- Follow availability of your guests
- Create an account and benefit from a follow-up of your events

Have fun !
