# shareMyEvents
The purpose of my application is to offer a private event to other people.  
Originally, I wanted to create an application in order to offer people the opportunity to create public outings and to offer them to other people who share the same passion.  
However, after careful research, I found there were many such applications out there, which were struggling to gain traction.   
Being myself a user of this kind of applications, I realised that there was not really offer for private events in which we just wanted to propose to his friends, his family, to participate in a meal, an evening, or more and to be able to centralize the needs within the same application.  
A lot of features came to me but I decided to focus on those that seemed essential to me to start.
